# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game Frogger. :frog:


## Installation
I recommend opening the game which is [here](https://electrovagance.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/). 
Just open the link and you are ready to go! :video_game: 
You could also clone the project, which I do not recommend simply because I will add more functionalities in the future.


## How to play
Once you open the link the game automatically starts. You move the player by using the arrow keyboard buttons (up, down, left, and right).


## Rules
Goal of the game is to successfully cross the stone road while avoiding colliding with enemies :beetle:. The game resets itself once you reach the water block or you get hit by an enemy.
